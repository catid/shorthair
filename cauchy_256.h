 * The output recovery blocks are stored end-to-end in the recovery_blocks.

 * The number of bytes per block (block_bytes) should be a multiple of 8.
 *
 * The sum of k and m should be less than or equal to 256: k + m <= 256.
 *
 * When transmitting the data, the block index of the data should be sent,

 * Cauchy decode

 * This recovers the original data from the recovery data in the provided
 * blocks.
 *
 * You should provide the same k, m, block_bytes values used by the encoder.
 *
 * The blocks array contains pointers to data buffers each with block_bytes.
 * This array allows you to arrange the blocks in memory in any way that is
 * convenient.
 *
 * The "row" should be set to the block index of the original data.
 * For example the second packet should be row = 1.  The "row" should be set to
 * k + i for the i'th recovery block.  For example the first recovery block row
 * is k, and the second recovery block row is k + 1.
 *
 * I recommend filling in recovery blocks at the end of the array, and filling
 * in original data from the start.  This way when the function completes, all
 * the missing data will be clustered at the end.
